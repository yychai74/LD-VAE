Resourceful Gauillaume finds a way to crawl in and out of the deserters prison camp to set up a contraband food trade with a local family. Vincent's unit experiences the horrors of disorderly retreat and attempts to stand their ground which prove futile, until the Yser floodgates are opened.

The kids have to find hidden tokens, and are grouped as Gatherers, Hunters or Settlers. Gemma (now working with the other Double Dare Gang members) suggests that they wind up new French teacher Christoph Urdy, by all saying "Je me piddle" rather than "Je m'apelle". Cracker thinks there are more important things going on though, when he witnesses Mrs. Holmes talking about monsters, and black slime in the now absent Mr. McNab's office. He can't resist taking a look, but the police are also headed for there. He holds the door handle inside the badly vandalized room, so they think it's shut. Joanna seems to have recovered from her drink problem - or is she just becoming better at hiding it? Chrisoph's having some difficulty controlling his riotous Year 8 class, especially when they seem to have their own version of French, what with "je me piddle" and "quatre cinq sex sept" - "sex is not right," he says to the amusement of his class. Dudley's getting nowhere with Claire who doesn't even notice his romantic aspirations while they are helping set up the tokens for Caveman Day. Joanna borrows money from Carlene to buy a present for her mum, but later seems to not have it - she makes an excuse about having lost it. Meanwhile, in the woods, Adam Hawkins gets "caught" by Dai Jones's hunter team, but seems to be taking things too seriously - he runs off into the no-go area. He trips and falls, and looks up to see an unshaven man, and vicious looking dog above him.

His guests are expecting great things from him as the "posh" one of the group, but as he has not divulged much information about himself during the week either, they also believe he could totally surprise them. He is confident about his chances of winning, especially after the first three meals. His menu consists of game terrine with chutney (fish terrine for kosher Bernice) as a starter, roast venison with black cherry sauce (seared tuna for Bernice) as the main course, and crÃªpes Suzette for dessert. His meal preparation does not start well and he hopes that mishap is not a sign of things to come. Three items hit the wow factor for the evening: a musical interlude by Anthony, a story by Ashley and dessert.

More than 2 million people were displaced by the earthquake. Tzu Chi volunteers arrived in Concepcion, which was one of the hardest hit areas. Once they settled in, they discovered the local people needed more than just earthquake relief. A more serious fundamental problem was at hand - poverty. In our "Footprints" segment, we share with you the personal journey of Frances Lee. Fluent in Chinese, English and Spanish; Frances Lee had assisted Tzu Chi's relief team in the 2010 Earthquake as the translator and the coordinator of the Buddha blessing ceremony.

It's an absurd reflection of the way you live when your not online - without being pre-occupied with social media. If we have to get all academic about it the show is a satirical examination of 'cocooning culture' and 'the mutilation of social gooditude' - i.e. Shut-Ins and the wonderful world of spending too much time inside. Conceptually the show is 'muppets in the modern age', we don't mean 'brightly coloured, singing things in a modern setting', what we're talking about is the answer to the question: 'what if the concept was invented today by independent filmmakers?' The series itself draws from the aesthetic of 'The Muppets', the format of 'Strongbad Emails' and the premise of 'ALF' while borrowing from the comedic tone of 'Regular Show', 'The Simpsons' and 'South Park' - among several dozen other inspirational movies, TV shows and comics that no-one in our core target demographic has heard of, or remembers... which will make you think our ideas are fresh and original.

But one of the residents does, when a fire is set in one of the homes on the street. The victim seems to have been involved romantically with a number of other residents, but it's not clear if the death was intentional or a by-product of the arson and the victim was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. DI Gil Mayo and the team investigate an explosion at the home of Susie Ludlow. She is nowhere to be found nor are her twin son and daughter. They do find the body of a man, Rob Jackson, who was separated from his wife, Jessica Crouch, a local hairdresser. The children are soon located in the care of Cal Andrews who tells the police that Susie is out of town and the reason Rob was in the house was because he was fixing the plumbing. Rumor has it however that Rob may have been having an affair with another neighbor, Kitty McNally. Turns out Rob may also have cheated another neighbor in a business deal. The thing everyone, including the victim, have in common is that they all went to the same school and one of their classmates all those years ago was bullied to the point of committing suicide. All in all, Rob was a bit of the local Romeo so there are any number who might want him dead.

The dead man had been away and his wife thought he was still there. She has no idea what he might have been doing in the neighborhood where he was found but does admit that he was something of a philanderer. The post-mortem reveals that he had actually drowned in a puddled in the garden rather than from the blow to the head. It turns out that one of the neighbors, Faith Loxley, also has a connection to Croatia. When a second body is found, this time in the graveyard, it points to Faith's sister, Hope Hendrick. It also seems that Dermot Voss had a business relationship with him. It turns out that lust and jealousy is at the root of the crimes.

It's an absurd reflection of the way you live when your not online - without being pre-occupied with social media. If we have to get all academic about it the show is a satirical examination of 'cocooning culture' and 'the mutilation of social gooditude' - i.e. Shut-Ins and the wonderful world of spending too much time inside. Conceptually the show is 'muppets in the modern age', we don't mean 'brightly coloured, singing things in a modern setting', what we're talking about is the answer to the question: 'what if the concept was invented today by independent filmmakers?' The series itself draws from the aesthetic of 'The Muppets', the format of 'Strongbad Emails' and the premise of 'ALF' while borrowing from the comedic tone of 'Regular Show', 'The Simpsons' and 'South Park' - among several dozen other inspirational movies, TV shows and comics that no-one in our core target demographic has heard of, or remembers... which will make you think our ideas are fresh and original.
